This data contains vibration signals collected from bearings of different health conditions under time varying speed conditions. 

There are a total of 36 data sets. For each data set, there are two experimental settings: 
* bearing health and 
* changing speed conditions.

Bearing health conditions include:

* (I) health,
  * (Ii) the inner ring is defective, and
  * (Iii) The outer ring is defective.

The operating speed conditions are:
* (I) increase speed,
  * (Ii) reduce speed,
  * (Iii) increase and decrease speed, and
  * (Iv) Decrease and increase speed.

Therefore, there are 12 different cases provided. In order to ensure the authenticity of the data, 3 experiments were collected for each experimental setup, resulting in a total of 36 data sets.
E
ach data set contains two channels:
* 'Channel_1' is vibration data measured by an accelerometer,
* 'Channel_2' is the speed data measured by the encoder.

All of this data is sampled at 200,000 Hz with a sampling duration of 10 seconds.
