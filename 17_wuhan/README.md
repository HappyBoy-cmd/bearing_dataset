## Description of this data
These data are denoised signals processed by wavelet thresholding-based denoising.

They are represented by a 2-dimensional matrix.

Each row represents a vibration signal, and the first 45 rows belong to mormal rotor, the second contact-rubbing, the third unbalance and the final misalignment.

Each column represents the length of data, 2048, or time, 1s.
