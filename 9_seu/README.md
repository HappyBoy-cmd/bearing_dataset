Gearbox dataset is from Southeast University, China. These data are collected from Drivetrain Dynamic Simulator. This dataset contains 2 subdatasets, including bearing data and gear data, which are both acquired on Drivetrain Dynamics Simulator (DDS). There are two kinds of working conditions with rotating speed-load configuration set to be 20-0 and 30-2. Within each file, there are 8rows of signals which represent: 1-motor vibration, 2,3,4-vibration of planetary gearbox in three directions: x, y, and z, 5-motor torque, 6,7,8-vibration of parallel gear box in three directions: x, y, and z. Signals of rows 2,3,4 are all effective.
