experimental data are collected from a benchmark two-stage gearbox with replaceable
gears as shown in Figure 7. The gear speed is controlled by
a motor. The torque is supplied by a magnetic brake which
can be adjusted by changing its input voltage. A 32-tooth
pinion and an 80-tooth gear are installed on the rst stage
input shaft. The second stage consists of a 48-tooth pinion
and 64-tooth gear. The input shaft speed is measured by a
tachometer, and gear vibration signals are measured by an
accelerometer. The signals are recorded through a dSPACE
system (DS1006 processor board, dSPACE Inc.) with sampling frequency of 20 KHz. As shown in Figure 8, nine
different gear conditions are introduced to the pinion on the
input shaft, including healthy condition, missing tooth, root
crack, spalling, and chipping tip with ve different levels
of severity.
