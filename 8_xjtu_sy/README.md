The bearing accelerated degradation test platform used in this experiment was designed by the joint laboratory and manufactured by Suntech. This platform can carry out accelerated degradation experiments of various types of rolling bearings or plain bearings, and obtain the life-cycle monitoring data of the bearings. The object of this experiment is the LDK UER204 rolling bearing. Three types of experimental conditions (35Hz12kN / 37.5Hz11kN / 40Hz10kN) have been designed. Five bearings were tested under each type of operating conditions.

### TABLE I OPERATINGCONDITIONS OF THETESTEDBEARINGS

| Operating condition | Radial force (kN) | Rotating speed (rpm) | Bearing dataset |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
Condition 1 | 12 | 2100 | Bearing 1_1 Bearing 1_2 Bearing 1_3 Bearing 1_4 Bearing 1_5 |
Condition 2 | 11 | 2250 | Bearing 2_1 Bearing 2_2 Bearing 2_3 Bearing 2_4 Bearing 2_5 |
Condition 3 | 10 | 2400 | Bearing 3_1 Bearing 3_2 Bearing 3_3 Bearing 3_4 Bearing 3_5 |
